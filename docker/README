CMPE202 Project

setup.sh:
-It will git clone my github repo that contain all the files that I need inroder to run run.sh.
The reason I need to clone from my project repo is because I set up my input/output of my
csv and plots to save into a specific folder.
-download R and r-base to use it for plotting tools.
-Builds the docker image file.

run.sh ($bash run.sh [threadnumber]):
-allow me to select the number of threads to use, it will run perf and output the measurements 
into a csv file then normalize it so it could be plotted using R.

I am able to plot all the throughput and latency graphs without docker
