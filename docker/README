CMPE202 Project

All the graphs will output to textblob-performance-analysis/dockerdata.

setup.sh:
-It will git clone my github repo that contain all the files that I need inroder to run run.sh.
The reason I need to clone from my project repo is because I set up my input/output of my
csv and plots to save into a specific folder.
-download R and r-base to use it for plotting tools.
-Builds the docker image file.

run.sh ($bash run.sh [threadnumber]):
	threadnumber:
		0: give the latency plot
		1: running with 1 thread
		2: running with 2 thread
		4: running with 4 thread
		8: running with 8 thread
		
-allow me to select the number of threads to use, once the thread is chosen, then it will output
the plots for 1T, 1T/4, 1T/16, 1T/64, 1T/256 instructions. Next, it will run perf and output the measurements 
into a csv file then normalize it so it could be plotted using R.

Without docker, I am able to plot all the throughput and latency.
With docker I couldn't get latency graph to work properly.
